These are homework assignments I did for CS 178 under Prof. Alexander Ihler in Fall 2019. Any data in a folder labeled "data" is freely available and any code in a folder labeled "mltools" is written by Prof. Ihler and/or any T.A.s he had at the time; they are not confidential, merely implementations of known algorithms for students to read and understand.
